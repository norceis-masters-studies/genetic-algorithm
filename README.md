# GeneticAlgorithm.py contains my implementation of genetic algorithm that accepts a function to approximate value for.
# This algorithm is then applied as an approximation function in ANFIS (Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), a tool for fuzzy logic operations.
# It is shown how it works in Laboratorium 3.ipynb, where it is used to teach ANFIS multiplication table.
